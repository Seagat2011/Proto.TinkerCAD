Electric Motor Prototypes

Here are electric motor prototypes I think may become viable for commercial use

The Finned-Stator / Fanned-Rotor design increases surface-area and, therefore, the flux field of the electric motor
allowing the motor to achieve the speed and the torque of a larger motor


Unified Stator & Neodymium Rotor Electric Motor w/ Builtin Transmission (Multistage)

The Neodymium Rotor Electric Motor uses a unified rotor and stator for multistage velocity achievement
 
The inner or outer rotors could be disabled to allow for energy re-capture, 
thereby decreasing top speed while increasing motor efficiency many orders of magnitude
