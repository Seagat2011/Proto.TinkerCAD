<h1>Electric Motor Prototypes</h1>
<hr>
Here are electric motor prototypes which may become viable for commercial use<br>

The Finned-Stator | Fanned-Rotor design increases surface-area and, thus, the flux field density of the electric motor allowing the fanned rotor electric motor to achieve the acceleration and the torque of much larger motors<br>

<h2>Unified Stator | Neodymium Rotor Multistage Electric Motor</h2>

<br>
The Neodymium Rotor Electric Motor uses a unified rotor and stator for multistage velocity achievement. The inner or outer stator | rotors could be disabled to allow for energy re-capture, thereby decreasing top speed while increasing overall motor efficiency many orders of magnitude<br>
